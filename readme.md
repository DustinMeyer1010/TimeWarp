# TimeWarp
TimeWarp is an application designed to help you build better habits, manage tasks, and track your progress toward a better life. It combines habit creation, task management, and time tracking into one powerful tool.

The core focus of TimeWarp is visualizing your progress. You’ll be able to see:

- Time spent on specific tasks
- Number of tasks completed
- Seeing progress through graphs and heatmaps

The name TimeWarp reflects the idea of starting your journey today and then “warping” into the future to see how far you’ve come.
