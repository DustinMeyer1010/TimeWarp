# 🌟 Habits
## ⏱️ Time-Based Achievements

Track habits with a built-in timer. Once the set time is reached, the habit is marked as achieved.
Timers can be:
- Started to begin tracking
- Paused and resumed at any time
- Adjusted manually if you need to log progress yourself
Every time the habit’s time goal is reached, an additional completion counter is added.

## ✅ Count-Based Achievements

Not every habit needs a timer. For quick tasks, simply tap to mark them as completed.
- No time limit required
- Can be completed multiple times per day
- Perfect for habits like drinking water or doing push-ups

## 🔥 Habit Heatmap

Visualize your progress at a glance with a daily heatmap.
- Each day shows whether habits were completed or missed
- Darker spots mean the habit was completed multiple times
- Makes it easy to spot streaks and gaps in your routine


# Todo's

Implement habits features but the only difference is that these can only be achieve once and then go away forever.
